    	I like clouds, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-art">op-art</a>, 
    	and the possibilities and tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a> 
    	in pop-art*, why not putting it all together?
    </p>
    <p>
		I've also come to know (and enjoy) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">
		Perlin noise</a>. That's a clever algorithm for generating random noise 
		that changes smoothly over any number of dimensions. For the sketch 
		shown above, Perlin noise is computed for x, y and t dimensions, as 
		clouds have random spatial density changing randomly over time. p5.js 
		has a builtin function for Perlin noise, so it's as easy as ABC 
		(although the scales for the dimensions involved must be carefully 
		tweaked to get a naturally-looking effect). You may have notice that the 
		clouds above travel slowly sideways, although the underlying dots have 
		static positions; that's simply achieved by increasing slightly over 
		time the value of the x dimension used to compute noise.

		I'd like to have the sketch above shown fullscreen, but for any reason 
		p5.js has poor performance drawing varying-size dots. Still working on 
		improving it.

		Lichtenstein</a> was prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Day_process">
		Ben Day dots</a> rather than halftone, but well, you know.
