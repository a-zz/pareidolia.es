    Just a first (and very humble) attempt at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art">generative art</a>.

    There's a huge comunity out there doing computer-generated visual art. Just google for 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=generative+art">"generative art"</a> or 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=procedural+art">"procedural art"</a> and be amazed.

    Generative art can be made by whatever system &mdash;not only computers&mdash; operating autonomously under previously, 
    human-defined rules, but computers definitely make it easy and affordable to anyone. Any platform or language can be used, but
    the trend here, as in many other fields, is to use JavaScript: simple to learn and use, runnable almost everywhere and with a
    very wide, active community providing utility libraries. Plain JavaScript and the HTML5 <em>canvas</em> element is enough, but
    specialized libraries like <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>, <a hreg="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> or (the
    more widely scoped) <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> provide for a simpler usage and a gentler learning curve.

    Most of the computer-generated visual art is probably dynamic, either autonomous or responsive to the spectator. I'm prone to
    static imagery, though. Consequently, the sketch above always shows a static picture, although it's generated of the fly 
    according to a predefined logic with some added randomness. Every time it's reloaded the picture will be alike-but-different.

    The sketch above is hosted at <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org">openprocessing.org</a>, a social website and community
    hub for the generative art aficionados. There're awesome works there.
